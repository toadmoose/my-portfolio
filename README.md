## About This Project

I wanted to create a portfolio that goes beyond the typical developer showcase. While demonstrating my full-stack development skills through modern React architecture, responsive design, and deployment practices, I also wanted visitors to get a genuine sense of who I am as a person. The SpongeBob-inspired aesthetic reflects my playful personality, while the interactive features and careful attention to user experience demonstrate my technical capabilities. Each section reveals different aspects of my interests - from my favorite films and music to my artwork - creating a complete picture of both my professional skills and personal character.
